# Intermittent Authentication Failure in Next.js API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where Next.js API route authentication using `unstable_getServerSession` fails intermittently.  Even with a valid session, the function sometimes returns `null`, resulting in unauthorized access errors.

## Problem

The `myRoute` API route utilizes `unstable_getServerSession` for authentication. However, in unpredictable circumstances, the session check fails, returning `null` despite a successful login. This causes intermittent 401 errors for authenticated users.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling and potentially adjusting session management. The provided solution demonstrates a simple retry mechanism and better error logging to diagnose the issue.
